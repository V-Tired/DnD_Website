                                We were happy when we were new. I was first and then she was born. Hecate is different from me. Hecate is born into short-lived, mortal bodies. She is born, she grows up, and she dies. She is the goddess of death magic and witchcraft, but she uses death as a cycle, not a thing to be conquered. But she didn't begin this way.

You see, sometimes when we creations interact we can become Wild, unstable. But not me. I can touch any god, and find them anywhere. I can speak all their languages and I know all their secrets. Their weaknesses.

                                Trees shook. Mountains erupted around me. Mortals died and lived and died again in a terrible loop. And to stop it all, the Star put me to sleep. He told me that I needed to rest my dust, and begin anew, as Hecate would. He promised me that for the rest of her days, Hecate would always be born again. But I had lost his trust.

                                I slept until I was called, and then I slept once more. I saw Hecate only in times or war or famine or plague. We found happiness where we could, but it wore on us like an unhealing wound. Sometimes I'd miss her entirely. I'd sleep through lifetimes. I'd wake to find her at the end or the beginning, where her mind knew nothing of me.

                                Hecate died, and in her next life she was born a daughter of the goddess Chantea. The earth mother had offered up her body to give Hecate a new beginning. But she was not alone. She had a twin. Funny how do often things come in twos.

Those stripped from the World Eater who followed Chantea to their last breath. Their stardust would be put back into this earth, and Chatea's twin spirits would create it in her image.

                                But what Hecate didn't know was how powerful she was, and how jealous her twin became lusting for the same strength. Her twin cursed her. Used her own magic against her, and trapped her in an evil, necrotic tome. The book was her prison, and she would continue to cycle as part of a sick and twisted series of luring mortals in with her power.
